  "description": "Talking Blocks listens to the Blockchain hash # and creates a unique artwork with a signature stamped into the image that is a direct message from the blockchain. This provides the collector an assurance of authenticity while leveraging the blockchain to generate a unique message, a retina print of the blockchain hash #. This is an instantly recognizable visual signature. You can interact with the artwork to modulate a sonic reaction of oscillating circular waves. The permanent immutability of the underlying token hash # is combined with a non-repeatable signature from a person interacting with the artwork, all in real-time. In other words, you can have a conversation with the Blockchain.",
