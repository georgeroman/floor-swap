  "description": "A collaborative project that transitions the visual aesthetic of a Matt Bilfield peg piece to the generative art world. “Pixels” from the physical world take on new life as the limitations of reality are removed and they are free to assemble and morph without the rigidity or permanence of wood, paint and glue. Round and square variants incorporate multiple color palettes into four unique styles, each with their own distinct attributes. Additional variety in dimensions, depth, color placement, animation, and light modes ensure no two are alike. Make sure to explore the intricacies of each piece by using the mouse to see all angles.
