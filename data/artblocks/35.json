  "description": "My interpretation of Aerial View is a bird's Eye View over a city block with illuminated/twisted buildings and light trails. It uses an on-chain stored algorithm to represent the generative artwork based on a hash. Each Aerial comes with different distances, building elevations, rotations and colors. Welcome to my genesis project and the first step on my on-chain journey!",
