  "description": "Event Horizon Sunsets are a class of art works generated through an algorithm which uses Perlin noise to modulate the color, shape, and convexity of a continuous surface. The sunsets are generated instantly in a practical infinity of combinations, and it is possible to write a machine learning classifier that selects the most beautiful ones. Event Horizon Sunset (Series C) follows two previous series of Sunsets, with 5 and 9 works respectively. Series C is special because some of the randomly generated Sunsets have a \"close proximity\".",
