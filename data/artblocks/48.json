  "description": "Gen 3, the third and final installment of the Gen-Trilogy series, uses word combinations to create unexpected phrases. The phrases play with meaning, or the idea of it,  while characterizing identities relating to blockchain and NFT culture in a fun and abstract way. Gen 3 continues an emerging trend of parsing the minted token's hash in order to produce a deterministic image or animation. For each Gen 3 minted, 40% of the proceeds are donated to a non-profit organization called EveryShelter whose mission is to repurpose waste products into useful materials designed to help people in need.
