The main environmental parameter of the composition is the determination of a season of the year. The season determines the landscape‚Äôs colors and defines specific phenomena for each of them, such as rain in summer, snow in winter, petals falling in autumn, and pollen in spring. The flower has several possible variables, which can be macro aspects, affecting the entire population of the species, or micro, affecting each individual of the species differently. For example, the number of petals can be equal in all individuals or not. The number of filaments and other structures of the flower can undergo minor deviations, generating small mutations. The confusion between the figure (plant) and the background (earth, sky, other natural elements) is fascinating from a compositional point of view. The background colors are, most of the time, colors present in the figures, often breaking the boundary between them and, therefore, generating chromatic masses. In this project I also intend to research the following question",

Whether connecting threads are carefully untied, crumbling from neglect, or snapping from tension, many couples can still safely go separate ways when needed. For some, there is no easy escape. Domestic violence, sexual abuse, financial hardship, and cultural norms can all keep someone bound to a partner against their will. To help those in need, 10% of artist proceeds from each sale will be donated to InterAct of Wake County, a private, nonprofit agency that provides safety, support, and awareness to victims and survivors of domestic violence and rape/sexual assault.
